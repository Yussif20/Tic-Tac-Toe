npm start
```

The game should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Core Concepts

### Two-Way Binding

Two-way binding is a core concept in React that enables seamless communication between the user interface and application data. In this game, two-way binding ensures that every move made by players is instantly reflected in the UI. This bidirectional connection between the game state and the user interface keeps the game interactive and responsive.

### Lifting State Up

Lifting state up is a fundamental practice in React development. In this Tic-Tac-Toe game, the state management is intelligently structured. The state of the individual squares is managed within the `Square` component, while the overall game state is lifted up to the parent `Game` component. Lifting state up simplifies the management of game history, calculating the winner, and allows for the smooth navigation of game moves.

### Managing Multiple States

In this game, various states must be meticulously controlled. The individual square states, game history, and the current step are examples of these states. By efficiently managing these multiple states, the game ensures that players can review their move history, jump back to previous steps, and even determine the winner when a game is finished.

## Additional Features

Aside from the core concepts mentioned above, this Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporates other exciting features:

- **Game History**: Players can review the entire game's history, including each move, by using the timeline at the side of the board.

- **Move Highlighting**: The game highlights the selected move to make it easy for players to keep track of their progress.

- **Restart and Time Travel**: Players can restart the game at any point or travel back in time to previous moves.

- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an enjoyable experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Winner Declaration**: The game will declare the winner and highlight the winning squares when a game is won.

By exploring and playing this React-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, you will gain insights into various core concepts, including those related to React, state management, and user interface interactivity. We hope you have a fantastic time playing and learning from this project. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to get in touch. Enjoy the game!
